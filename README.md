# Project Title: The Melancholy of Longevity
Name: Ziwei He, Zheng Lian, Lucas Lu

Project Goal: To identify the critical predictors for human life expectancy based on Emory students' data.
Background: Following the technological advancement in recent decades, we expect people's life expectancy to significantly increase than in the past. However, an worrisome trend of young people living in high-risk life style is observed by the scientific community. Scholars have shown that in recent decades, young generation are increasingly engage in leisure activities that involve the use of alcohol and other substances (e.g., nightclubbing), all of which impact their health. Moreover, young people tend to be over-stressed by the intense 21st century work culture and suffer mental health issues. The downstream consequences are that young people sleep less, eat irregularly, and not exercise well. These unhealthy behaviors of young people lead to the conjecture that whether the life expectancy of this generation is affected. Do risk behaviors outweigh the benefit that medical innovation bring to people's longevity? If so, what are the most important factors that influences peoples' life expectancy at this day and age. To answer these questions, this research investigates the factors that shapes peoples' life expectancy in twenty first century using data collected from Emory students.

Description: Our method is to collect Emory students' data from a survey. We will ask about their diet, sleep time, exercise level, and other lifestyle questions. Then, we will research to see the correlation between each factor and life expectancy. We will use then plug in the factors of each student to predict their life expectancy.

Conclusion: Our analysis indicates that diet is the single most important predictor for life expectancy. The more unhealthy one eats for their diet, the more likely they are to have a decreased life expectancy. This result is in congruent with our initial hypothesis.

Challenge faced: 
1. We had difficulty use the git functions in real-life scenarios. We solved this by referring back to the class slides, discussing, and using try-and-error.
2. The most challenging part of the project is the merging. We could not figure out why our merging kept failing. We utilized multiple resources including ChatGPT, Stack Exchange, and Github. We went through the steps both collaboratively and individually, trying to trouble shoot. Finally, we found three ways to solve the problem: 1. Set up the sections in a specific way before breaking into our branches (Ziwei). 2. Use git pull to update frequently and merge individual changes afterwards (Zheng). 3. Use pull requests and manually solve the conflicts in Github (Lucas).
