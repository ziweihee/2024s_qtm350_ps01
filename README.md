# The Melancholy of Longevity

Project Goal: To identify the critical predictors for human life expectancy based on Emory students' data.
Background: people are eating less.How does this kind of new type of eating behavior affect their longevity? In this reasearch we seek to explore this topic.
Name: Ziwei He, Zheng Lian, Lucas Lu
Method: Our method is to collect Emory students' data from a survey.
Conclusion: Our analysis indicates that diet is the single most important predictor for life expectancy. The more unhealthy one eats for their diet, the more likely they are to have a decreased life expectancy. This result is in congruent with our initial hypothesis.
